WikiZen is a minimal Markdown-based wiki engine for simple Wikis.
WikiZen serializes a Wiki into one JSON object, which makes it storable **anywhere**.

## How to Use

Following shortcuts are supported:
- `e` opens the current page in editing mode;
- `n` opens the new-page mask;
- `d` deletes the current page;
- `1` till `9` opens the `n`th child of the current page;
- `Left Arrow` navigates to previous page;
- `Escape` to go to the parent page;
- `0` to return to the root page.
